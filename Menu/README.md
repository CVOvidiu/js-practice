## Menu project

### Idea

We will have a menu containing menu items and some filtering options. We can sort the menu items using the filters.

### Actions

1. There will be four filters: All, Breakfast, Lunch, Shakes.
2. At start, menu items will be loaded dynamically and will populate the page. 'All' filter will be selected as default.
3. Using the filters will sort menu items accordingly.
4. Data will be stored locally.

### Notes

Project done 100% by me.
