## Sidebar project

### Idea

We will have a button that toggles the left-side bar which contains a logo, closing button, link buttons including social media links.

### Actions

1. Clicking a button toggles sidebar
2. Clicking x button contained into the sidebar, closes it.
3. When sidebar's size gets smaller, its width will be full

### Notes

Project done 100% by me.
